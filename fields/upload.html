<p>Handling file uploads is a very common attack vector used to compromise (hack)
a server. BoltForms does a few things to help increase slightly the security of handling
file uploads.</p>
<p>The following are the &quot;global&quot; options that apply to all form uploads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">    uploads:
        enabled: true                           # The global on/off switch for upload handling
        base_directory: /data/customer-uploads/ # Outside web root and writable by the web server's user
        filename_handling: prefix               # Can be either "prefix", "suffix", or "keep"
        management_controller: true             # Enable a controller to handle browsing and downloading of uploaded files</code></pre>
<p>The directory that you specify for <code>base_directory</code> should <strong>NOT</strong> be a route
accessible to the outside world. BoltForms provides a special route should you
wish to make the files browsable after upload. This route can be enabled as a
global setting via the <code>management_controller</code> option.</p>
<p>Secondly, is the <code>filename_handling</code> parameter is an important consideration
for your level of required site security. The reason this setting is important
is, if an attacker knows the uploaded file name then this can make their job a
lot easier. BoltForms provides three uploaded file naming options, <code>prefix</code>,
<code>suffix</code> and <code>keep</code>.</p>
<p>For example, when uploading the file <code>kitten.jpg</code> the settings would provide
something similar to the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Resulting file name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>prefix</code></td>
<td>kitten.Ze1d352rrI3p.jpg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>suffix</code></td>
<td>kitten.jpg.Ze1d352rrI3p</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>kitten.jpg</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We recommend <code>suffix</code>, as this is the most secure. Alternatively <code>prefix</code> will
aid in file browsing. However, <code>keep</code> should always be used with caution!</p>
<p>Each form has individual options for uploads, such as whether to attach the
uploaded file in the notification message, or whether to place the uploaded file
in a separate subdirectory or the given global upload target.</p>
<p>A very basic, and cut-down, example of a form with an upload field type is given
here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">file_upload_form:
    notification:
        enabled: true
        attach_files: true             # Optionally send the file as an email attachment
    uploads:
        subdirectory: file_upload_dir  # Optional subdirectory
    fields:
        upload:
            type: file
            options:
                required: false
                label: Picture of your pet that you want us to add to our site
</code></pre>
<h2 id="post-upload-browsing">Post-Upload Browsing</h2>
<p>When <code>management_controller</code> is enabled, a file in the <code>base_directory</code>
location is accessible via <code>http://your-site.com/boltforms/download?file=filename.ext</code>.</p>
<p>These files can be listed via the Twig function <code>boltforms_uploads()</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-twig">    {{ boltforms_uploads() }}</code></pre>
<p>This can be limited to a form's (optionally defined) subdirectory by passing the
form name into <code>boltforms_uploads()</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-twig">    {{ boltforms_uploads('file_upload_form') }}</code></pre>
                </section>
